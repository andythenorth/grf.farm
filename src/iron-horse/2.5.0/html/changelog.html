<h2>2.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>"Whoa Runaway horses...Racing through the darkness....Runaway Horses." - Belinda Carlisle</p>
<p>2 years in the making, Iron Horse 2 is an end-to-end rework of Iron Horse.</p>
<p>Same focus on gameplay.</p>
<p>Greatly expanded set of vehicles, strongly inspired by British trains.</p>
<p>All sprites redrawn.</p>
<p>Dive in and play.</p>
<p><em>Recommended OpenTTD settings</em></p>
<ul>
<li>'Vehicles never expire: Off'</li>
<li>'Weight multiplier for freight to simulate heavy trains: 1'</li>
<li>'Enable wagon speed limits: On'</li>
<li>these settings are recommended, but not required</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improved Tech Tree</em></p>
<ul>
<li>6 distinct generations of vehicles</li>
<li>first trains introduced around 1860</li>
<li>last new trains introduced around 2022</li>
<li>engines now have clear roles, displayed in buy menu<ul>
<li>freight</li>
<li>general purpose / express</li>
<li>high speed / very high speed</li>
<li>high capacity urban</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>engine roles depend on OpenTTD setting 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'<ul>
<li>without this setting Iron Horse 2 works fine, but some freight engines will overlap general purpose / express engines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>greatly expanded range of vehicles</li>
<li>some Iron Horse 1 vehicles have been kept, with new stats and sprites, all other vehicles are new</li>
<li>all stats rebalanced, including speeds, power and costs</li>
<li>357 trains in total, Iron Horse 2 is designed to be used with OpenTTD setting 'Vehicles never expire: Off'</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Engines</em></p>
<ul>
<li>added wider range of low-power, medium-power and high-power engines<ul>
<li>Iron Horse 1 had gaps where there wasn't really an appropriate engine for some routes</li>
<li>medium-power engines were especially lacking in Iron Horse 1 after 1935</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>electric engine roster expanded to 16<ul>
<li>12 electric</li>
<li>4 electro-diesel (bi-mode)</li>
<li>first electric engine available around 1905</li>
<li>Iron Horse 1 included only 4 electric engines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Railcars</em></p>
<ul>
<li>expanded railcars to 20<ul>
<li>16 standard gauge and 4 narrow gauge</li>
<li>Iron Horse 1 included only 3 railcars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>dedicated variants for<ul>
<li>passengers</li>
<li>mail/express freight</li>
<li>Iron Horse 1 relied on refitting passenger railcars to handle mail/express freight, which was faff, and can't be used reliably with auto-refit in stations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>added electric and electro-diesel railcars</li>
<li>first railcars now available around 1925</li>
<li>railcar appearance will automatically adapt to consist, creating single cars, or multiple-unit trains</li>
</ul>
<p><em>High Speed / Very High Speed Trains</em></p>
<ul>
<li>added dedicated high speed and very high speed trains</li>
<li>fastest train in Iron Horse 2 is 186mph (Brenner, available around 2018)<ul>
<li>155mph Screamer from Iron Horse 1 is removed, these trains replace it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>maximum speed will only be available with dedicated passenger coaches</li>
<li>first high speed train available around 1980</li>
<li>first very high speed train available around 1987</li>
<li>very high speed trains include<ul>
<li>distributed power: all coaches are powered</li>
<li>tilt bonus for faster speed through curves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Wagons and Coaches</em></p>
<ul>
<li>added wider range of wagons and coaches<ul>
<li>Luxury Passenger Coach</li>
<li>Express Van</li>
<li>Curtain Side Van</li>
<li>Sliding Wall Van</li>
<li>Tarpaulin Wagon</li>

<li>Mineral Wagon</li>
<li>Chemicals Tanker</li>
<li>Cryo Tanker</li>
<li>Grain Hopper</li>
<li>Fruit &amp; Vegetables Van</li>
<li>multiple lengths for wagons and coaches, increasing visual variety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>some Iron Horse 1 wagons are missing from Iron Horse 2, but will be restored in future when sprites are finished<ul>
<li>Intermodal Flat Car</li>
<li>Metal Car (torpedo wagon)</li>
<li>Supplies Car</li>
<li>Vehicle Transporter Car</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combine Car is removed permanently, as it cannot work with OpenTTD autoreplace</li>
<li>passenger coach and mail van appearance automatically adapts to consist<ul>
<li>alternative liveries depending on attached engine</li>
<li>sprite variants such as brake coaches, restaurant cars, post office vans as appropriate</li>

<li>simpler but more useful narrow gauge engine roster</li>
<li>expanded narrow gauge railcars, first available around 1950</li>
<li>expanded narrow gauge wagon and coach types</li>
<li>narrow gauge engines and railcars are somewhat 'inspired by' French and Corsican trains, as British and Irish narrow gauge is more limited</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Metro Trains</em></p>
<ul>
<li>sprites redrawn</li>
<li>minor stats adjustments</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improved Visual Appearance</em></p>
