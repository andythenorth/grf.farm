2.0.0 Release
-------------

"Whoa Runaway horses...Racing through the darkness....Runaway Horses." - Belinda Carlisle

2 years in the making, Iron Horse 2 is an end-to-end rework of Iron Horse.

Same focus on gameplay.

Greatly expanded set of vehicles, strongly inspired by British trains.

All sprites redrawn.

Dive in and play.

*Recommended OpenTTD settings*

- 'Vehicles never expire: Off'
- 'Weight multiplier for freight to simulate heavy trains: 1'
- 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'
- these settings are recommended, but not required


*Improved Tech Tree*

- 6 distinct generations of vehicles
- first trains introduced around 1860
- last new trains introduced around 2022
- engines now have clear roles, displayed in buy menu
    - freight
    - general purpose / express
    - high speed / very high speed
    - high capacity urban
- engine roles depend on OpenTTD setting 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'
    - without this setting Iron Horse 2 works fine, but some freight engines will overlap general purpose / express engines
- greatly expanded range of vehicles
- some Iron Horse 1 vehicles have been kept, with new stats and sprites, all other vehicles are new
- all stats rebalanced, including speeds, power and costs
- 357 trains in total, Iron Horse 2 is designed to be used with OpenTTD setting 'Vehicles never expire: Off'


*Engines*

- added wider range of low-power, medium-power and high-power engines
    - Iron Horse 1 had gaps where there wasn't really an appropriate engine for some routes
    - medium-power engines were especially lacking in Iron Horse 1 after 1935
-  electric engine roster expanded to 16
    - 12 electric
    - 4 electro-diesel (bi-mode)
    - first electric engine available around 1905
    - Iron Horse 1 included only 4 electric engines


*Railcars*

- expanded railcars to 20
    - 16 standard gauge and 4 narrow gauge
    - Iron Horse 1 included only 3 railcars
- dedicated variants for
    - passengers
    - mail/express freight
    - Iron Horse 1 relied on refitting passenger railcars to handle mail/express freight, which was faff, and can't be used reliably with auto-refit in stations
- added electric and electro-diesel railcars
- first railcars now available around 1925
- railcar appearance will automatically adapt to consist, creating single cars, or multiple-unit trains


*High Speed / Very High Speed Trains*

- added dedicated high speed and very high speed trains
- fastest train in Iron Horse 2 is 186mph (Brenner, available around 2018)
    - 155mph Screamer from Iron Horse 1 is removed, these trains replace it
- maximum speed will only be available with dedicated passenger coaches
- first high speed train available around 1980
- first very high speed train available around 1987
- very high speed trains include
    - distributed power: all coaches are powered
    - tilt bonus for faster speed through curves


*Wagons and Coaches*

- added wider range of wagons and coaches
    - Luxury Passenger Coach
    - Express Van
    - Curtain Side Van
    - Sliding Wall Van
    - Tarpaulin Wagon
    - Coil Car
    - Plate Wagon
    - Stake Wagon
    - Coal Hopper
    - Mineral Wagon
    - Chemicals Tanker
    - Cryo Tanker
    - Grain Hopper
    - Fruit & Vegetables Van
    - multiple lengths for wagons and coaches, increasing visual variety
- some Iron Horse 1 wagons are missing from Iron Horse 2, but will be restored in future when sprites are finished
    - Intermodal Flat Car
    - Metal Car (torpedo wagon)
    - Supplies Car
    - Vehicle Transporter Car
- Combine Car is removed permanently, as it cannot work with OpenTTD autoreplace
- passenger coach and mail van appearance automatically adapts to consist
    - alternative liveries depending on attached engine
    - sprite variants such as brake coaches, restaurant cars, post office vans as appropriate


*Narrow Gauge Trains*

- simpler but more useful narrow gauge engine roster
- expanded narrow gauge railcars, first available around 1950
- expanded narrow gauge wagon and coach types
- narrow gauge engines and railcars are somewhat 'inspired by' French and Corsican trains, as British and Irish narrow gauge is more limited


*Metro Trains*

- sprites redrawn
- minor stats adjustments


*Improved Visual Appearance*

- reworked all sprites
- added multiple livery options for many vehicles (random, or when vehicle is flipped in depot)
- all vehicle lengths now 4/8, 6/8, 8/8, 10/8, or 12/8
    - easy to make exact tile-length trains if desired
- depot flip enabled for many vehicles (was disabled in Iron Horse 1 as a side effect of how vehicles were coded)
- more accurately positioned visual effects
- rear lights on consists
- electric vehicle pantographs are raised on electric rails, otherwise lowered
- doors open on many vehicles when loading/unloading


*Cargos*

- updated cargo support for FIRS

*Docs*

- improved display of trains
- better navigation
- added a basic gameplay guide

*Translations*


- default translations now appropriate to British English (previously used US English)
- multiple languages updated


*Codechanges*

- reworked Makefile and general approach to compiling
- improved compile speed, including very fast compiles if only sprites are changed
- removed the requirement that all vehicles are articulated (was used to support vehicles with sprites longer than 8/8)
- reworked graphics generation
    - automated buy menu sprites
    - automated cargo sprites
    - automated chassis and roofs
    - automated pantographs
- added shared library of cargo sprites, cargo refits etc with Road Hog and Unsinkable Sam
- refactored classes and templates
- simplified vehicle definitions, removing boilerplate and redundancy


*Known issues for 2.0.0 release*

- there may be a period during 1860s when engines are available, but no suitable wagons (or wagons but no suitable engines), this is due to randomised vehicle introduction dates and will be fixed in future
- loading speeds are unbalanced, and some vehicle types may load too slowly or too quickly, this will be fixed in future
- electric and electro-diesel engines might behave incorrectly on electric railtypes where the label isn't 'ELRL', this may be fixed in future
- Iron Horse 2 grf and docs are not published on #openttdcoop bundles server, this may be fixed in future
- Brenner cab doors do not open when loading, this will not be fixed
